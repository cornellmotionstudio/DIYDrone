# DIYDrone

This is the starting point for building one of our Motion Studio drones.

Current models available:
* Dylan REV2 (LEFT)
* Jackson REV2 (RIGHT)

**Dylan** features a custom-designed 3D printed frame, and COTS (commercial off the shelf) hardware running open-source flight software that is typically used for hobbyist drones. 

**Jackson** features a custom-designed 3D printable frame and a built-from-scratch Raspberry Pi Pico-based Flight Controller hardware/software. Its software provides convenient APIs for several onboard peripherals, such as the ESC, IMU, and Radio Receiver. So the new developers and users can pick it up faster.

## Getting Started

The base, i.e. frame, guards, motors and propellers, are the same for all models. The only different parts are the electrical components.

Start by following the instructions in the [Hardware Assembly](https://github.com/cornellmotionstudio/DIYDrone/wiki) 
wiki page.

Once you are done, you should navigate to the specific model you are building to complete the electrical and 
software parts: [Dylan](https://github.com/cornellmotionstudio/DylanDrone/wiki) or 
[Jackson](https://github.com/cornellmotionstudio/JacksonDronev2/wiki).
