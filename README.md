(to do: add blurb about each model and updated pictures)

## Getting Started

The base, i.e. frame, guards, motors and propellers, is the same for all models.

Start by following the instructions in the [Hardware Assembly](https://github.com/cornellmotionstudio/DIYDrone/wiki) 
wiki page.

Once you are done, you should navigate to the specific model you are building to complete the electrical and 
software parts: [Dylan](https://github.com/cornellmotionstudio/DylanDrone/wiki) or 
[Jackson](https://github.com/cornellmotionstudio/JacksonDronev2/wiki).
